#Emojibot


A Twitter bot that automatically translates your tweets into emoji, via the magic of Mechanical Turk.


### Installation

`emojibot` is go-get installable:

````sh
go get github.com/ChimeraCoder/emojibot
````

### Credentials

You will need your AWS credentials:


````sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id-goes-here"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key-goes-here"
````

You will also need Twitter application credentials

````sh
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="etc."
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="etc."
````

I would highly recommend using a dedicated Twitter account for posting the translations, unless the people you follow on Twitter really love emoji:

````sh
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="access token for dedicated account"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="access token secret for dedicated account"
````

# Heroku

Running `emojibot` on Heroku is easy. Create a Go application with 

````sh
heroku create -b https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
````

and make sure you define the Heroku environment variables (`heroku config:add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="etc."`)
